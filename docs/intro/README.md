# Overview

The guiding philosophy of Redux-Leaves is *"write once, reduce anywhere"*.

This page explains more about the motivation of Redux-Leaves and how its design philosophy is put into practice.

## Motivation

### Why?

Redux is useful, powerful and great!

But some developers complain about the boilerplate being [tedious, cumbersome and convoluted](https://medium.com/@Charles_Stover/no-boilerplate-global-state-management-in-react-41e905944eb7).

Can we make it easier for developers to get the use, power and great developer experience from Redux?

> **Redux-Leaves aims to make Redux easier to learn *and* quicker to scale**.

### How?

Let's consider some of the developer complaints against Redux.

* "Redux requires a ton of tedious code to do the most basic things"
* "It often feels tedious to do trivial state changes"
* "Redux has too much boilerplate, and I have to maintain all of it"
* "New developers have a problem with flux architecture and functional concepts"
* "Redux requires a ton of files to establish a new reducer"

Maybe that developer experience would be better if we could:
1. **Quickly set up** Redux for basic state changes;
2. **Intuitively create actions** for arbitrary needs; and
3. **Cut down boilerplate** of reducers drastically?

> **What if Redux state management could be quicker, more intuitive and leaner?**

### What?

Redux-Leaves lets you *write once, reduce anywhere* with:
- [Quick setup](features.md#quick-setup);
- [Intuitive API](features.md#intuitive-api); and
- [Minimal boilerplate](features.md#minimal-boilerplate).

### Scrimba course

There's an interactive [Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/c/cNqRmKtZ) which demonstrates Redux-Leaves used with the [React-Redux hooks](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks).

It's aimed at new developers, to show how Redux-Leaves can be an easier way to learn Redux, although it also demonstrates the library to more experienced developers who want an interactive playground.
