## Motivation

### Why?

Redux is described as having ["three fundamental principles"](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles):

1. **[Single source of truth](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles#single-source-of-truth)**: "The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store";
2. **[State is read-only](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles#state-is-read-only)**: "The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened"; and
3. **[Changes are made with pure functions](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles#changes-are-made-with-pure-functions)**: "To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers".
